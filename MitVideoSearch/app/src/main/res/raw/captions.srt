1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,080
what the heck is going on everybody
welcome

2
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:06,012
your very first to ruin I O S the
bellman

3
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:10,048
with swift now in this is world series
well I'm going to do

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,100
is I'm gonna show you guys had a great
are some I West aP's

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,025
and that includes the iPad the iPod
Touch

6
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:20,093
the iPhone any actually you wanna make
well

7
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:23,702
you are not because this is the greatest
World Series

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,380
ever created noun before you started I
want to mention a couple things

9
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:33,102
for small what is swept I never heard in
this thing called swift before

10
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:37,071
going to mail your computer programming
model a know what the heck's going on

11
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,118
there

12
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:42,018
well whenever Apple first allow
developers make

13
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:46,019
arm like I was axed for the iPhone or
whatever they used a programming

14
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,868
language called objective-c

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,134
but now just a few months ago they came
out with the brand new language coats

16
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:52,048
with

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,602
and it's pretty much the future %uh I
was the bellman

18
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,780
so before we get into you know adding
all the buns and stuff on your haps

19
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:02,096
I'm gonna teach you guys this computer
programming language

20
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:06,171
and then once we learn basis abet we can
move on to making cool like iPad app for

21
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:08,135
iPhone app's what everyone knew

22
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,038
so now that is underway

23
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:15,065
let's go ahead and get started I don't
want to be as you know like a huge a

24
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,324
long intro about the history of it but

25
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,950
you notice a little quick info so the
first thing you need to do when everyone

26
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:22,184
create Iowa sabes is

27
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:27,086
you need an Apple ID and if you go to
this website right here

28
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,129
developer dot Apple dot com you probably
already have one

29
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:34,068
if you're working with Matt this is
where you can pretty much

30
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:38,103
arm set up all your accounts of so the
first thing you need is an Apple ID

31
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:44,009
so if you click this pine in Apple ID is
pretty much just so

32
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,398
I don't know like any arm like Google

33
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,497
has you make an account ya whom it has
you make an account

34
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,683
well this is like Apple's account for
their main on overall everything

35
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,750
so of course you just fill in your first
name are your email password typical

36
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,084
stuff right here

37
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:04,127
I actually already have an Apple ID and
like I said I'm guessing you do too

38
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:08,075
absence text me ray in the middle my
store /url

39
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,127
much worse go ahead and

40
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:15,031
read it word is this a is my moon

41
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:20,054
noon she says dinner at her house
tonight they're having meatballs

42
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:24,153
so looks like I'll be eating me post
money cool cool are

43
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:28,096
so now they have an Apple ID again I
didn't want to talk you through that

44
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,153
because like typing your name type in
your last name

45
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:35,101
movie you know you guys keep hearing
that out but now what we need to do

46
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:41,030
is we need to create a developer account
now whenever we have a developer account

47
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:44,040
what we can do this is we can download
all the cool tools

48
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,128
like Xcode and Xcode is pretty

49
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:51,066
it's just like a really fancy text
editor that you can use to rate your

50
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:51,118
code

51
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:55,049
and there's also like the IRS SDK that
we need

52
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,131
in this is pretty much arm in the

53
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:02,129
software development kit specific to I
was absolutely awful stuff

54
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:07,084
Taylor to developing like iPhone and
iPad app so those are two things that we

55
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:07,152
need to get

56
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,057
so let's go ahead and sign in now if you
had to do that

57
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,113
so sign in almost lost their developer

58
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:18,098
Kunis sign in okay

59
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,106
lonely it but i wanna be come are

60
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:26,015
Apple Developer the NRA so

61
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:30,066
definitely read all that I know it look
like I was a remember trust me as I am

62
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:34,072
original speed reading 11 are so just
agree to this

63
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:38,031
in OK are your first question what role

64
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:41,084
best describes you probably aren't like
incredibly good-looking deny

65
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:45,098
no don't know that one so to say that I
am A R

66
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:50,156
suffer engineer when he started building
for Apple platforms will say

67
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:55,059
pick whatever we want now what are you
developing

68
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:58,086
I'm only been shown you guys had to
develop Iowa saps

69
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:01,090
anything for mobile handheld devices

70
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:05,014
so I'm just going to click abstrait
there we can also do with this

71
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:09,019
these tools is you can just develop like
regular software

72
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:13,072
for the Mac like I don't know I programs
like Skype in

73
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:16,150
you know like photo editors whatever you
want so if you wanna

74
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:20,064
do any that then you can follow whatever
but again this is for a series is just

75
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,067
for

76
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,104
iPhone in Iowa saps so okay

77
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:28,046
were other platforms to develop forward
Android

78
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:32,065
in a a merchant when those two little
bit driver

79
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:36,114
on the side re: now register think
courageous there you are now

80
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:42,079
able to sign in to the website so hit
continue and check this out
